# FilterGuard

FilterGuard is a simple PHP library for data sanitization. It provides methods to sanitize strings, integers, floats, boolean values, arrays, and objects. The library helps protect against common security vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL injection attacks.

## Usage

Include FilterGuard in your PHP project by including the main library file `FilterGuard.php`. You can then use various methods of the FilterGuard class to sanitize data.

### Examples

```php
<?php
// Including FilterGuard library
require_once 'FilterGuard.php';

// Sanitizing a string
$dirtyString = '<script>alert("XSS attack!");</script>';
$cleanString = FilterGuard::string($dirtyString);
echo $cleanString;

// Sanitizing an integer
$dirtyInteger = '123abc';
$cleanInteger = FilterGuard::integer($dirtyInteger);
echo $cleanInteger;

// Sanitizing a float
$dirtyFloat = '12.34xyz';
$cleanFloat = FilterGuard::float($dirtyFloat);
echo $cleanFloat;

// Sanitizing a boolean value
$dirtyBool = 'true';
$cleanBool = FilterGuard::bool($dirtyBool);
echo $cleanBool;

// Sanitizing an array
$dirtyArray = ['<script>alert("XSS attack!");</script>', '123abc', '12.34xyz'];
$cleanArray = FilterGuard::array($dirtyArray);
echo $cleanArray;

// Sanitizing an object
$dirtyObject = (object) ['dirtyString' => '<script>alert("XSS attack!");</script>'];
$cleanObject = FilterGuard::object($dirtyObject);
echo $cleanObject;

// Sanitizing an auto
$dirtyValue = '<script>alert("XSS attack!");</script>';
$cleanValue = FilterGuard::auto($dirtyValue);
echo $cleanValue;
```
